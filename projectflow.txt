create git repo and clone it to local
create mycode.py and add code t it(it will save a .csv file to a new "data" folder)
do git add,commit,push
instal dvc (pip install dvc)
now we do dvc init(creates .dvcignore, .dvc) (exps will show after logign some exp,check once)
mkdir s3(creates a new s3 directory)
how do we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"(if we relaly have s3 bucket we will give s3 bucket url)
(myremote can be any name,not myremote only)
next "dvc add data/"(this will give errro as git already tracked)
give in cmd prompt (git rm -r --cached data)
then (git cmmit -m "stop tracking data")
now u will see /data folder in .gitignore
and in data.dvc every change is stored with id (check once for review)
we can see md5 in cache adn data file and id file(basically every time data canges it keeps track)
now give dvc add data/
now we can add git add .gitignore data.dvc
now dvc commit and then dvc push

do a git add-commit push to mark tgis stage as first version of data
now make changes to mycode.py to append a enw row in data ,check changes via dvc status
again dvc commit and dvc push
create a new row and python mycode.py
dv commit and pushgit add and commit and push
we can see new data id md5 and data also in versioning
